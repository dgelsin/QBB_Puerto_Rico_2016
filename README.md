An introduction to bioinformatics and a tutorial on RNA-seq analysis in halophilic Archaea

Knowledge and proficiency in bioinformatics is more important than ever in this day and age in biology. With the advent of high throughput and cheap sequencing technologies huge datasets are becoming more available. In order to work and parse through these datasets, a biologist needs to have a good familiarity with UNIX environments, scripting, and stastistics. While most of the ideas are the same between Eukaryotic and microbial bioinformatic analysis there are indeed some considerations to take and different software/pipelines to use to specifically study Bacteria and Archaea. This workshop is designed to introduce you to the field of bioinformatics and expose you to the tools available for microbial bioinformatic analysis (focusing on organisms from halophilic environments). The workshop is divided into three modules: 1) Quality control (QC) of raw sequence data, 2) RNA-seq alignment and quantitation 3) RNA-seq differential expression and visualization.

###The learning objectives are:
>Become familiar with working with big data sets (“-omics”), emphasis on microbial genomics
>Exposure to the most recent bioinformatic programs
>Ability to work in a UNIX environment, command-line, executing programs
>Literacy in file structure of big data sets
>RNA-seq analysis in *Haloarchaea*
